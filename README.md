I am a student of Software Engineering in Usman Institute of technology (UIT).
I have built the architecture of a single-cycle RISC-V single core processer and implemented its simulation on logisim.

## Supported Instructions:

Create a .txt file and place the ***hexadecimal*** code of your instructions simulated on ***Venus*** (RISC-V Simulator)\
Each instruction's hexadecimal code must be on seperate line as following. This program consists of 9 instructions.
```
00500113
00500193
014000EF
00120293
00502023
